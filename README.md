# VBA Challenge - Yearly Stock Data Analysis

## Summary:

This VBA script addresses the analysis of yearly stock market data for various tickers across multiple years. The script calculates yearly changes and percentage changes in stock prices, highlights results with color-coded backgrounds, determines total stock volumes, and identifies stocks with the "Greatest % Increase," "Greatest % Decrease," and "Greatest Total Volume." Special thanks to instructors Mizanur Rahman and Hassan Mehmood for additional guidance.

## Bonus Feature:

The bonus part allows users to obtain a merged summary of data in a separate sheet, grouped by ticker and year.

## Dataset Insights:

The dataset includes yearly changes in stock prices and corresponding percentage changes, representing shifts in stock value over the years. Positive and negative changes indicate stock gains and losses. The dataset identifies tickers with the greatest percentage increases and decreases, offering insights into significant shifts. Furthermore, summary statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, and range can be calculated for a broader understanding of data distribution and variability.

## Note on Stock Analysis:

This challenge focused on VBA code creation for stock analysis. A comprehensive stock analysis requires additional context and information about companies and market environments. The dataset lacks key details such as sector or industry information, dividend yields, P/E ratios, and other fundamental data crucial for a thorough analysis.

## Acknowledgments:

This code was developed with the help of my tutor Kyle Goode. The issue with running on all sheets was partially resolved with assistance from ChatGPT, which was also utilized for understanding functions and formulas. Additional thanks go to instructors Mizanur Rahman and Hassan Mehmood.
