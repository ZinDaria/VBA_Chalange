This code was created by me with assistance of my tutor Kyle Goode. 

The issue with runing on all sheets partially solved with help of ChatGPT. Also used it for understanding some functions and formulas. 

Additional thanks for help to my instructors: Mizanur and Hassan Mehmood.



The dataset includes yearly changes in the stock prices (possibly representing the change in stock value over the course of a year) as well as the corresponding percentage changes.

We have data for multiple years, so we can analyze the trends of different stocks over time to identify patterns and recurring behaviors.

There are both positive and negative changes, indicating that some stocks have gained value while others have lost value.

The dataset mentions the tickers with the greatest percentage increase and decrease. This can provide insights into the stocks that have experienced significant positive or negative shifts.

Additionaly we can can calculate summary statistics for the columns such as mean, median, standard deviation, and range to understand the overall distribution of the data and the level of variability.

In this challange we only practised to create code in vba. Stock analysis is complex and requires more context and information about the companies and the market environment. This dataset missing key details like the sector or industry of each stock, dividend yields, P/E ratios, and other fundamental data that would be useful for a more comprehensive analysis.
